# connect-three
This game is based off of Connect Four and is played in the same way.

#### To Play:

The players take turns adding a piece to the game board until someone gets three pieces in a row. The winning pieces can be in any direction up down or diagonal.

#### To Make a Turn:

One player clicks on one of the white spaces on the gameboard. The piece will then move to the lowest open spot in that column. The game will automatically alternate the other player's color for their turn. 

#### To Reset:

The game automatically displays a message when one player has won the game. After a short period of time the board will automatically clear. In addition, the reset button will automatically clear the board at any point during the game.
